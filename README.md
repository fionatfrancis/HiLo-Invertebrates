# HiLo-Invertebrates

This analysis is for Sharon Jeffrey and is part of an overall project looking at the effect of curret speed on fish and invertebrate communities at different sites in the Straight of Georgia. Jillian Campbell's MSc analysis was also a component of this project. 

Sharon is interested in using a mixed-effects model to look at how different factors including site current speed, depth and substrate type affect invert biomass and invert % cover.
